# How to Import these Script Templates
To use these script templates, simply this script templates folder into the root of your Assets folder. So for example a path should look like:

Assets/ScriptTemplates/01-Decision Tree__Action-NewAction.cs.txt

Once you have done this, simply restart your editor and then you should be able to:

- Right Click -> Create -> Decision Tree -> Action
- Right Click -> Create -> Decision Tree -> Decision
- Right Click -> Create -> Decision Tree -> Function
- Right Click -> Create -> Decision Tree -> Condition
