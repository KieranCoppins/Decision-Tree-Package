# Simple Node View

The visual editor now contains two different views. Inside the tool bar there is an option to toggle *simple node view*.

Simple node view displays the inspector view of a node in a side bar, whilst the node contains the generated descriptions. By toggling this off, the inspector is placed within the body of the node and replaces the description. Although making nodes larger, it allows you to modify fields of a node without needing to select them and navigating to the inspector view.
